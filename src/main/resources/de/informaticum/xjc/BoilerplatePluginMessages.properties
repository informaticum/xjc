OPTION_DESCRIPTION=Generates common boilerplate code.

GENERATE_EQUALS_DESCRIPTION  =Generate [{0}] method (automatically enables option ''{1}''). Default: false
GENERATE_HASHCODE_DESCRIPTION=Generate [{0}] method (automatically enables option ''{1}''). Default: false
GENERATE_TOSTRING_DESCRIPTION=Generate [{0}] method. Default: false

EQUALS_IMPLNOTE  =<a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">This actual '{'@code equals'}' method has been generated by the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                  It compares each declared field of '{'@code this'}' instance with the according field of the '{'@code other'}' instance. \
                  Further comparison is delegated to the '{'@code super'}' '{'@code equals'}' method.
HASHCODE_IMPLNOTE=<a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">This actual '{'@code hashCode'}' method has been generated by the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                  It considers the hash-code of each declared field of '{'@code this'}' instance to compute the overall return result. \
                  Further calculation is delegated to the '{'@code super'}' '{'@code hashCode'}' method. \
                  (If there is no field at all, the hash-code of '{'@code this'}' instance''s '{'@linkplain #getClass() class'}' is returned instead.)
TOSTRING_IMPLNOTE=<a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">This actual '{'@code toString'}' method has been generated by the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                  It returns a human readable list of all declared fields of '{'@code this'}' instance, each mapping to its own string representation. \
                  Further string representation is derived from the '{'@code super'}' '{'@code toString'}' method.
