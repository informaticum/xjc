EQUALS_IMPLNOTE  =@implNote This actual '{'@code equals(Object)'}' method has been generated by <a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                            It compares each field of '{'@code this'}' instance with the according field of the '{'@code {0}'}' instance. \
                            Further, the current implementation returns '{'@code false'}' at an early stage if the '{'@code {0}'}' instance is not an instance of the same class as '{'@code this'}' instance. 
HASHCODE_IMPLNOTE=@implNote This actual '{'@code hashCode()'}' method has been generated by <a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                            It considers the hash-code of each field of '{'@code this'}' instance to compute the overall return result. \
                            If there is no field at all, the '{'@linkplain java.lang.Class#hashCode() hash-code of this instance''s class'}' is returned instead.
TOSTRING_IMPLNOTE=@implNote This actual '{'@code toString()'}' method has been generated by <a href=\"https://github.com/informaticum/xjc\">the informaticum''s XJC plugins</a> during the JAXB/XJC code generating process. \
                            It returns a human readable list of all fields of '{'@code this'}' instance, each mapping to its own string representation.
