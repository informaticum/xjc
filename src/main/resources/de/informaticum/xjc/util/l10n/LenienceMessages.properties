SERIOUS_PROBLEM=If you see this failure message you are facing a serious problem. \
                (You should find the details within the last log message immediately before this failure message.) \
                Even if it will cost you some time you should tackle this problem at its root. \
                For example, fix the XSD declarations, use proper XSD types/hierarchy, utilise custom XML adapters, a.s.o. \
                (You may skip this breaking information by setting system property ''{0}'' to 'true' but this is strongly discouraged. You better fix the problem.)
